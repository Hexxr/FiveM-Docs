# NUI: What & Why

**NUI** is the HTML-based user interface functionality in the CitizenFX framework. Currently using the chromium environment, it offers an asynchronous, great way of creating in-game UI using web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS, including frameworks like React or Angular, and acc WebGL).



Use `useState`, props, and component logic for dynamic UI updates.
